We’re looking forward to seeing you for PitchFest practice on DAY. 
We’ll go through your pitch again, provide feedback based on the judging criteria, and you’ll have a chance to ask any questions. 
We’ll focus on content and framing to make sure that it’s tailored to the event and the audience. 
Please add your script to this [shared document](LINK) before the session.
